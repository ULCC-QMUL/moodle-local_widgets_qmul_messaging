# moodle-local_widgets_qmul_messaging

This is a subplugin of Synergy's local_wdigets plugin.
It will be included in the type directory of this plugin as a git submodule.
It is a thin presentation layer of qmul_messaging plugin that allows certain users to post notification messages by roles.
It was agreed at the time of release that the widget and plugin would be called 'Notifications' as using the word messages was misleading.
